1. What will be output from the code below and why?
var b = “foo”;
(function () {
  var a = b = “bar”;
})();
console.log(b);

The resulting output will be "bar".  Since the variable b is defined outside of the
function and also called outside of the function, it would be logical to assume that the
result of the console.log would be "foo".  However, in this instance, JavaScript reads
var a = b = "bar" as:
  var a = b;
  b = "bar";
rather than, maybe intuitively:
  var a = b; // undefined
  var b = "bar";
Given this reality, b becomes a global variable without the var designation as is the case at the top declaration of b and therefore overrides the "foo" with "bar" as the output.
