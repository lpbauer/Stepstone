<!-- 5. Create basic web page to display information from an API. The API returns 2016 revenue for companies in different industries. The page should have a list view of all the data which can be sorted by revenue and company name, and a user can search for a specific company. In addition to the list you should create a graph displaying total revenue by industry. Finally create a simple form input that allows the user to add additional revenue information for an existing company. The fields should list the available companies and inputs for year and revenue. It should not allow a user to add revenue for a year that already exists.
You should commit your code to Github and send us the link to the finished page. You can use any JavaScript tools or libraries that you see fit.
